# TRADE TREE CREATOR


## Basic Information
### What is Trade Tree Creator?
Inspired by the [series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo12SYwt93STnVXNy8XYOSLP4IMBrMhDr) on TSN by [Steve Dangle](https://twitter.com/Steve_Dangle?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) this site will 
allow you to select any two players that have been traded for each other and build out a tree that will 
show the different leafs that exist stemming from that one single trade.

### Is Trade Tree Creator Free?
Yes! Anyone can run this program and create their own trade trees!

### Where does the data for Trade Tree Creator come from?
Currently, all data comes from [hockeydb.com](https://www.hockeydb.com), shout out to them for 
having all of it publicly available 

### How to run Trade Tree Creator
1. Clone the repository
2. [Install python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. Run the script
   - For Windows Users
     * Open CMD and type `./run_trade_tree_windows.sh`

4. Go to the [hosted site](http://127.0.0.1:8080/static/index.html) <br>

It's that simple!

### Will this ever become its own site?
Maybe! Due to the fact that I have not spoken to the owner of hockeydb.com to discuss if
they are fine with my accessing their data I have decided to take the safe route and make
the service self-hosted.
